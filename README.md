Hi All👋🏻
Recently I saw a [cool post](https://dribbble.com/shots/17263648-Dentist-s-App) with a design that I wanted to replicate on SwiftUI 🧐
Some images taken directly from their post, some downloaded. Therefore, you can see that the image of the jaw is of poor quality 🤫
I decided to make my own animations. It was a difficult and interesting task 🧠
Too many mistakes are made in the work, thanks to which I understand that there is still something for me to strive for 🏃‍♂️
Design by: Dmitry Lauretsky 💪
